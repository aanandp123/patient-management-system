# patient-management-system

I made this web application for a local physiotherapist who has a successful practice wherein she visits her patients’ home for appointments. Most of the patients are above the age of 60 years.

Her biggest problem lies in communicating with patients and keeping track of patient information. She currently uses iMessage, Instagram and direct calls to communicate with each patient. This form of communication is inefficient as it causes problems in keeping track of each patient’s appointments, exercise regimen and overall progress. Appointment dates with each patient are lost in the long chats and it becomes very difficult to schedule appointments with multiple patients on a single date due to the information being scattered in multiple places. The client has even used small hand written notes sometimes too which can easily be misplaced and add to the confusion.

I realized that the major problem was the lack of a single communication and record- keeping platform that could display every patient’s record in a simple understandable way. I needed to ensure that all of the communication occurs via the created software and no other social media platform.
