# patient-management-system

## Rationale
I made this web application for a local physiotherapist who has a successful practice wherein she visits her patients’ home for appointments. Most of the patients are above the age of 60 years.

Her biggest problem lies in communicating with patients and keeping track of patient information. She currently uses iMessage, Instagram and direct calls to communicate with each patient. This form of communication is inefficient as it causes problems in keeping track of each patient’s appointments, exercise regimen and overall progress.

I realized that the major problem was the lack of a single communication and record- keeping platform that could display every patient’s record in a simple understandable way. I needed to ensure that all of the communication occurs via the created software and no other social media platform.



## Features:
1. A register page that allows a new user (patient) to enter his/her details and create an account.

2. A login page that allows users (patients) and the admin (physiotherapist) to access the website.

3. A user homepage that displays the upcoming appointments with the admin for the month.

4. An admin homepage that displays all the appointments she has with different users for that month.

5. Admin should be able to schedule appointments with a user, which are then added to the admin’s Google Calendar.

6. The user should be able to request an appointment with the admin.

7. The user should be able to view the exercise list and the admin should be able to edit it.

8. The admin should be able to view a sorted list of all users with their details and search for a specific user.

9. The admin should be able to generate a pdf invoice for a user with the final charge to be paid.

10. The admin should be able to import and export patient details to and from Excel

11. All appointments, requests and exercise lists will be deleted on a monthly basis.
